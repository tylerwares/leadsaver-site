    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: <strong>October 4, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Leadsaver service (the “Service”). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you are agreeing on behalf of a company, you represent that you are authorized to bind that company.</p>

    <h2>1) The Service</h2>
    <p>Leadsaver helps businesses automatically send a text message to a caller after a missed call. Leadsaver is <strong>not</strong> a phone carrier or booking platform. We may update or modify features from time to time.</p>

    <h2>2) Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and have authority to enter into these Terms.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for the security of your account and credentials and for all activity under your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> You will comply with all applicable laws and carrier rules, including but not limited to CASL (Canada), TCPA/CTIA (U.S.), and privacy laws. You are responsible for obtaining any required <strong>consent</strong> to text your customers.</li>
      <li><strong>Content:</strong> You are solely responsible for message templates and content you configure in the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Numbers & Routing:</strong> You authorize us and our telephony providers (e.g., Twilio) to send and receive messages on your behalf using numbers assigned to your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Fees & Trials</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fees are disclosed at purchase or in your order form (e.g., monthly subscription; setup fees may be waived during promotions).</li>
      <li>If offered, free trials are one-time per account. Trials may have usage limits. After a trial, continued use requires a paid plan.</li>
      <li>All fees are billed in advance and are non-refundable except where required by law or expressly stated otherwise.</li>
      <li>Carrier/SMS usage costs or overages may apply depending on plan and region.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Term & Cancellation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your subscription renews automatically each period until cancelled.</li>
      <li>You may cancel at any time effective at the end of the current billing period via your account or by contacting <a href="mailto:support@leadsaver.ca">support@leadsaver.ca</a>.</li>
      <li>We may suspend or terminate the Service for violation of these Terms, non-payment, or risk to the Service or others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No spam, unlawful, misleading, or harmful content.</li>
      <li>No harassment or deceptive practices.</li>
      <li>No attempts to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>We and our licensors own all rights in the Service, including software, branding, and documentation. You grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to process your content as needed to provide the Service.</p>

    <h2>8) Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of the Service is subject to our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how we collect and use information.</p>

    <h2>9) Beta & Feedback</h2>
    <p>We may invite you to test beta features. Betas are provided “as is,” may be discontinued at any time, and may be subject to additional terms. You grant us a license to use feedback to improve the Service.</p>

    <h2>10) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not warrant uninterrupted, timely, or error-free operation, message deliverability to any particular carrier, or business outcomes.</p>

    <h2>11) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party will be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or loss of profits or revenues. Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Service will not exceed the amounts paid by you to Leadsaver in the 3 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

    <h2>12) Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Leadsaver and its affiliates, officers, and employees from any claims arising from your use of the Service, including your messaging content, lack of required consent, or violation of laws or carrier policies.</p>

    <h2>13) Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify the Service and these Terms. If changes are material, we will provide notice (e.g., via the site or email). Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>14) Governing Law & Venue</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. The courts located in Ontario, Canada will have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
